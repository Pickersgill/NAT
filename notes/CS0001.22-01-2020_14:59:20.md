	### History:
	*- written by Larry Wall in 1987
	*- strong influence from C
	*- written by a linguist, has natural like -esque features.
	
	- <ac=CG1>Common Gateway Interface
	- Perl was used to write CGIs which were popular in the early days of the internet
	- Perl is great for "quick and dirty" code

## Language:
	- UNTYPED :-(
	- Variables do not need to be pre-prepared
	- No terminators (no ';')
	- Allows trailing commas in lists
	- whitespace *is* whitespace
	- strings without quotes are consider "ok"
	- Perl has a "default variable"
	- can use warnings and strict to solve the variable problems
	- natural language features:
		*- Perl has singular and plural
		*- meaning dependant on context
		*- pronouns
		*- word order
	- Sigils:
		*- $x = 1 is a singular variable ($)
		*- @x = (1, 2, 3) is an array (@)
		*- %x = is a hash variable - dictionary - (%)
	- the fat comma: '=>' is equivilent to ','
	- hashes as lists, are arrays, i.e @x = %x
	- variables are identified by sigil and name, %s != @s
	- $x = @x, assigns the length of array @x to $x
	- $x = %x, assigns the length of @x=%x (i.e. for dict of length 3, $x = 6)
	- scalar forces an array to give a scalar value
	- "print scalar @x" behaves differently to "print @x", the latter prints the list
	- do Block: do { ... }, can be modified by 'while' or 'undo'
	- do Expression: do $something, assumes something is a file name and runs that file
