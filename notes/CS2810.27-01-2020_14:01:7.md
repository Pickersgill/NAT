### Refactoring


- Described as changes to a code base which change it in some non-functional way, i.e readability, simplicity or performance.

- Both code and UIs can be refactored.

- Types of code smell:
	
	- Bloaters; long methods, large class, long/too many parameters

	- Dispensables; duplicate code, data classes, lazy class
	
	- Change Preventers; divergent change, shotgun surgery, parallel inheritance hierarchies

	- Couplers; feature envy, message chains

	- Object Oriented Abusers; switch statements, temporary field

- Types of UI smells:

	- FAQ's/Guides, your UI should not be complex enough to require a guide
	
	- Hard to implement

	- Excessive iconography, put some words somewhere

- Refactoring workflow:
	
	1- Save original code
	
	2- Make sure tests pass

	3- Find the code smells

	4- decide how to refactor 

	5- Apply the refactoring

	6- reperform tests

- A comprehensive test suite is important to ensuring correctness during refactoring.

- Refactoring creates risks;
	
	- introduce new bugs
	
	- "waste" time not developing features
	
	- easy to waste too much time trying to get perfect code; daedalus

	- general rule to follow is to refactor the 20% of the code which is active during 80% of operation

	- the focus of your changes should focus on the zipf-ey distribution of code usage

## Duplicated code:
	
	- Similar or identical code in codebase

	- makes changes harder, changes have to be done for each instance of the same code block
	
	- Excraction; extract the duplicated code from it's multiple sources into 1 location.
	
	- Extract method, move multiple methods in one class to a single method

	- Extract method + pull up, if duplicate exists in two classes, move the code into a superclass

	- Extract class, duplicated code in two classes, create seperate object containing the code

## Feature envy:
	
	- Tight coupling of classes,
	
	- Code uses methods of another class more than it uses it's own

	- related functionality and data should be moved together

	- Refactoring template to cure this is "move method"
