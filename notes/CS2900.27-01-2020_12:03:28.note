### Matrices:
	- Notate with capital letters, M
	- Row and Columns; Mij, i = row, j = column
	- Operation on vectrs M_u_ = _v_.
	- Matrices are linear transformations.
	- They map from one vector space to another.

## Matrix Compositions:
	- Only the diagonal of the matrix is populated with non-zero values.
	- let A and B be matrix rotations for theta1 and 2.
	- _v_ = A_u_
	- _w_ = B_v_
	- Thus, _w_ BA_u_
	- AB != BA for all matrixes
